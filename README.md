# todolist-svelte-firebase

This todo app was built using Svelte (for frontend) and Firebase (as a database) based on [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm_Qt4aKpfKiGbdjaHdOpry6Neza0etxZ) and is [hosted on Heroku](https://todolist-svelte-firebase.herokuapp.com/). To enter a todo, simply type it into the text input box and click "Add". Mark a todo as completed by clicking the ✓ button and delete a todo by clicking the ✗ button. Todos are stored in Firebase so they will be persisted throughout sessions.
